This project is a VR game developed in Unity. Players find themselves within a gigantic cube, where pillars shoot out from the walls towards the player, aiming to terminate the game. The game operates on a round-based system. Throughout the cube, orbs are scattered, and the player's objective is to collect all orbs to progress to the next round. 

There are six types of pillars: slow, default, quick, row, mass, and point. The pillar types are determined using a weighted randomization system, with each round introducing changes to these weights, altering the likelihood of each type spawning. 

The game offers three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. In easy mode, the areas where pillars will emerge are highlighted, and the orbs are slightly larger for easier collection. Medium and hard modes do not include the highlight feature, with hard mode featuring smaller orbs. Each difficulty level has its unique weighted randomization settings.

Pillars are not aimed directly at the player but rather towards the area around them, ensuring constant danger as players move throughout the cube.
